                <p>The <b>Symfony2 RAD Edition</b> is based on the work of the <b>KnpRadBundle</b>.</p>
                <p>Its purpose is to provide a more opiniated edition of Symfony2 than the standard one. Basically, it accelerates some processes during your development that we think are recurrents, here at KnpLabs.</p>
                <p>We believe that these enhancements allow us to quickly prototype and deliver better tested projects.</p>
                <p>Feel free to collaborate and give us your opinion about this edition.</p>

                <h3>Many thanks to all the awesome contributors of this bundle!</h3>
